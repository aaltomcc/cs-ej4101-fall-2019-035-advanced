<p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300.png#float" alt="Placeholder image"></p>
<p>I work as a system specialist part time.
In the meanwhile I am studying computer science.
I am majoring in software and service engineering.
I therefore have a strong professional interest
in all things related to software development.</p>
<p>Other than that I have done a lot of student community volunteer work.
The local student community is really cool, and easily worth contributing to.
From that volunteer work I have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the human aspects of working on projects in a group.
I have also consistently pursued those skills in my professional life and studies.</p>

            <p>this course 035 I took this course out of curiosity. I have a few years of professional experience as a service operations engineer (or in a similar role). So I didn't really expect to learn anything shockingly new.
I did, how ever, think it would be a good idea to be at least aware on what kinds of things are tought as &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; in an academic context. At the same time I could ensure I had not missed anything important while picking the basics up during work.</p>

            <p>learned 035 I came into this course expecting to learn little. My expectations were met. But it is probably for the best. My participation was doomed from the start as far as the course staff might be concerned.
A few new things came up during the project. Those are mainly related to the specific tooling used for this project, since most of them I have not used before.
Hugo seems decent enough.</p>
