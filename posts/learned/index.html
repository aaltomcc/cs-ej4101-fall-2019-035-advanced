<p>I came into this course expecting to learn little.
My expectations were met.
But it is probably for the best.
My participation was doomed from the start
as far as the course staff might be concerned.</p>
<p>A few new things came up during the project.
Those are mainly related to the specific tooling
used for this project,
since most of them I have not used before.</p>
<p>Hugo seems decent enough.
Using static files,
where the use of static files
is sensible, is a great practice.
And markdown is always convenient
for simply structured text.</p>
<p>Travis was easy enough to use.
But it did fail to wow me on any level.
Using yaml as a syntax for anything
other than loosely structured data
is always a horrible idea.
I think I will stick to Jenkins.</p>
<p>Github pages played their own role well.
If I were hosting documentation for an open-source project
I would probably use those.
Then again, just hosting static pages is not exactly rocket science.
I would have been curious to see if there are any fancier features there.</p>
