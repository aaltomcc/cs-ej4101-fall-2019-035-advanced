# About

![Placeholder image](https://via.placeholder.com/300.png#float)

I work as a system specialist part time.
In the meanwhile I am studying computer science.
I am majoring in software and service engineering.
I therefore have a strong professional interest
in all things related to software development.

Other than that I have done a lot of student community volunteer work.
The local student community is really cool, and easily worth contributing to.
From that volunteer work I have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the human aspects of working on projects in a group.
I have also consistently pursued those skills in my professional life and studies.
