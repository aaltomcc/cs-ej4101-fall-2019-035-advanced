## this course 035

I took this course out of curiosity.
I have a few years of professional experience
as a service operations engineer (or in a similar role).
So I didn't really expect to learn anything shockingly new.

I did, how ever, think it would be a good idea
to be at least aware on what kinds of things
are tought as "DevOps" in an academic context.
At the same time I could ensure
I had not missed anything important
while picking the basics up during work.

As a bonus. There is of course a credit on offer.
That does not hurt as far as I am concerned.

I do not really understand how this one question
is expected to range from 250 to 500 for a post.
Since I seem to have covered the content of the question
and am only about half way done with the word count.
I could ramble on or leave it here.
